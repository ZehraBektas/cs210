# Apple Health Data Analysis Project 🏥

## About the Project 🚀

This project revolves around the analysis of my personal health data obtained from the Apple Health app. The motivation behind this exploration is to gain insights into my activity levels, daily step count, and the impact of my music-listening habits on my overall health.

## Motivation 💡

As a regular iPhone user, I had the Health app but never delved into its data before. This project was born out of the curiosity to understand my activity patterns, daily step count, and assess the healthiness of my music-listening habits.

## Data Source 💿

The data source for this project is the iPhone Health application, which offers a tool to export health data in XML format. To facilitate analysis, I utilized a converter to translate the XML data into CSV format, making it compatible with dataframes for further exploration.

## Data Analysis 📊

### Data Preprocessing 🤖

The initial data format was not optimal, necessitating preprocessing. Date formats were adjusted, null values were checked, and a general overview of the data was obtained. Various preprocessing methods were applied to enhance data clarity.

### Analysis Techniques 🧐

A diverse range of data analysis techniques and visualization methods were employed to make the analysis more interpretable. The project involved exploring correlations, patterns, and trends within the health data.

## Findings 🕵️

1. **Activity Levels:**
   - Only 1.5% of the overall data recorded more than 800 steps, suggesting a relatively inactive lifestyle.

2. **Audio Exposure:**
   - Approximately 20% of audio exposure exceeded the recommended healthy limit of 85 decibels.

3. **Music Listening and Walking:**
   - A low correlation was observed between music listening and walking activities.

4. **Caloric Burn:**
   - The data revealed a minimal caloric burn through walking activities.

## Limitations 🚧

- Lack of Apple Watch usage limited the available data to steps, walking distance, flights climbed, and audio exposure. Additional metrics like heart rate could not be included in the analysis.

## Future Work 🚀

- Planning to acquire a smartwatch to track heart rates, enabling a more comprehensive analysis.
- Future data integration will allow for the application of machine learning models to identify patterns and correlations within the health data.
- The goal is to explore potential relationships between heart rate and other health metrics for more robust analysis.

This project provides a snapshot of my current health insights, and future iterations will aim to enhance the analysis with additional data and advanced modeling techniques.
